📘 Text Emotion Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine-learning based emotion classifier that identifies the underlying emotion present in a user’s text input. It uses a trained model (text_emotion.pkl) to classify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, anticipation, trust, surprise, neutral, and more.

The application is fully interactive using Streamlit, and also displays the probability distribution in both graph and table format for better interpretability.
